# API project "Dutch Word"

Link - <https://odrinl.github.io/dutch/>

## Description

Dutch Word is API project and a client-side dictionary app with simultaneous translation any Dutch word into 10 different languages, audio with pronunciation, articles we have to use with nouns - "het" or "de", relevant pictures, and explanation in Dutch. All on one screen. I used API of Google Translate, Wiktionary, Wikipedia and Pixabay. I did this project in the time of API module during my study at HYF. I have been dreaming about such an application for a long time and finally managed to do it by myself. I was very excited doing it. If you want to make it better - let me know by making a pull request.

## Design

Very simple, I wanted it to look very light, like google result pages. Much more important was the ease of use and the content itself.

## Features

### Must have

1. Create the project structure
2. Create a field for user request (Dutch word)
3. Create the schema for translation this word to English

### Nice to have

1. translations to Urdu, Russian, Ukrainian, Arabic, Tigrinya, Turkish, French, Farsi, Somali.
2. NL-NL explanation (as in Van Dale dictionary)
3. Right article for the noun

### Additional ideas (for future)

- Sound file with pronunciation (done)
- Related images (done)
- Wiki page for this word (done)
- If the word is a verb - show all forms for this verb (done, and for nouns also, but could be improved)
- Word in context, something like in Context Reverso
- Show the list of synonyms
- Add a feature for checking and unchecking desirable searching recourses - button, which opens Settings, saving settings for current user
