# API project "Dutch Word"
## Description
Dictionary app where foreigner can find all you need about any Dutch word - pictures, pronunciations, explanation and even all forms for verbs. I have been dreaming about this app for so long and finally it's time to make this dream come true.
## Design
Very simple, I want it to look very light, for example like google result pages. Much more important is the ease of use and the content itself.
## Features
### Must have
1. Create the project structure
2. Create a field for user request (Dutch word)
3. Create the schema for searching results:
- translation to English
- sound file with pronunciation
- NL-NL translation
- images
- wiki page for this word (if it exists)
- word in context

### Nice to have
1. translations to Ukrainian, Russian, Arabic, Tigrinya, Turkish
2. If the word is a verb - show all forms of this verb
3. Show the list of synonyms
4. Add a feature that you can check and uncheck desirable searching recourses
