## Description

Client-side web application. Dictionary app where foreigner can find all you need about any Dutch word - simultanious translation into 5 different languges, correct article, relevant pictures, and explanation in Dutch (Wikipedia article). Everithing on one screen. I have been dreaming about this app for so long and finally it's time to make this dream come true.

## Design

Very simple, I want it to look very light, for example like google result pages. Much more important is the ease of use and the content itself.

## Features

### Must have

1. Create the project structure
2. Create a field for user request (Dutch word)
3. Create the schema for translation this word to English

### Nice to have

1. translations to Urdu, Russian, Arabic, Tigrinya, Turkish
2. NL-NL explanation (as in Van Dale dictionary)

### Additional ideas (for future)

- Sound file with pronunciation
- Related images
- wiki page for this word (if it exists)
- word in context
- If the word is a verb - show all forms of this verb
- Show the list of synonyms
- Add a feature for checking and unchecking desirable searching recourses
